		<h1>Generic Families</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>Serif</li>
			<p>These fonts are defined by their having serifs, or a <q>flaring, cross-stroke 
			or other ornamentation </q>(Daggett, 3.1) on the end of each stroke in the letter.  
			They tend to appear more formal and give their document or signage a more official feeling.</p>
				<li>Sans-Serif</li>
			<p>These are typefaces used without the serifs, 
			which tend to be more plain and serve a variety of roles.</p>
				<li>Cursive</li>
			<p>Belonging in this group is any font which has a <q>rolling</q> or 
			<q>flowing</q> pattern in which letters connect or seem to almost connect to each other, 
			and generally resembles handwriting.</p>
				<li>Fantasy</li>
			<p>Arguably the most wide-ranging of the generic families, fantasy ranges along a spectrum of 
			any style which would not be included in any of the other families, and mostly for purposes of fun 
			and amusement.</p>
				<li>Monospace</li>
			<p>In this typeface, each figure takes up the same amount of space on a line, with <i>m</i>, 
			for example, taking up the same amount of room as <i>i</i>. This makes the need for kerning 
			less necessary, given that the spacing has been completely worked out within the typeface itself.  
			Often these fonts have the appearance of something that would appear on typewriters of old, 
			and offer a formal style, leaning towards fun.</p>
			</ul>
