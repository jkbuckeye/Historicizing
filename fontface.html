		<h1>@Font-face</h1>
		<p>This CSS rule allows for the replacement of fonts with other fonts from different formats if 
		the fonts which are being used are not found within the parameters of the browser being used. This means that if a 
		given font is not found, the site will be rendered with the next available 
		font on the list (or re-set to the default of the given generic family, if none are found). Each of these subsequent fonts
		can be retrieved from a different Open-source format, as long as the format itself is specified in the rule. </p>
		<p>@font-face also allows for the definition of composite fonts to a given site, if there is a need for some glyphs from a different alphabet in a font which 
		does not normally carry those glyphs.  In this case, the Unicode range must be defined for the character of that usage.</p>
		<p>Many suggest alternatives to @font-face, which are in some ways thought to be more effective because they do not rely on the 
		rendering to pick the most appropriate font, but rather link directly to it. One of these methods is to link to an image of the less-web-safe font in 
		the place you want this text to be read. Another method called <q>Cufon</q> is said to be a worthy alternative to the 
		aforementioned image-replacement.</p>
