			<h1>Web Font Historicizing</h1>	
			<div class="pure-u-1">
				<h2>One</h2>
				<p>In my historicizing project, I am going to look at what it took to convert the fonts we’ve been 
				using for the printed word into web-ready versions.  From what I have read so far there are aspects
				of projecting fonts that I wouldn’t have thought of before.  These aspects affect how a specific font 
				is rendered to most closely reflect the author or designers intentions with a message.  But as we were seeing once again in Duckett, 
				there are plenty of ways font sometimes needs to be manipulated for a sight to be more readable.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="pure-u-1">
				<h2>Two- How Do We Render Text Now?</h2>
				<p>@font-face- this CSS rule allows for the replacement of fonts with other fonts from different formats 
				if the fonts which are being used are not found within the parameters of the browser being used.  This means that if a given font is not found, 
				the site will be rendered with the next available font on the list (or re-set to the default of the given generic family, if none are found).  
				Each of these subsequent fonts can be retrieved from a different Open-source format, as long as the format itself is specified in the rule. </p>
				<p>@font-face also allows for the definition of composite fonts to a given site, if there is a need for some glyphs from a different alphabet in a font which 
				does not normally carry those glyphs.  In this case, the Unicode range must be defined for the character of that usage.</p>
				<p>Many suggest alternatives to @font-face, which are in some ways thought to be more effective because they do not rely on the 
				rendering to pick the most appropriate font, but rather link directly to it. One of these methods is to link to an image of the less-web-safe font in 
				the place you want this text to be read. </p>

				<p>SIFR, which was invented in 2004, is another way to render text that is not your bland, everyday browser fare. What sIFR does is very similar to image replacement, but it grants more sizing capabilities 
				and allows the text to more succinctly blend into the content of a page as if it were written in the HTML of the webpage.  It does, however, require a Flashplayer to render, 
				which not everyone has, and it uses Javascript to over-write the HTML code if the appropriate player is installed.</p>
				<p>Another method called <q>Cufon</q> is said to be a worthy alternative to the 
				aforementioned image-replacement.</p>
				<p>Speaking for those of a certain feeling, the inventor of sIFR explained, <q>Do we like standards? Yes, we do. But will we sacrifice our own ability to create better work on the web because of them? No, we won’t. Well, some people will.  I won’t.</q></p>
			</div>
			<div class="pure-u-1">
				<h2>Three: Issues</h2>
				<p>Subsetting is a method by which a web designer can manually eliminate certain glyphs from a given font, 
				assuming that the language he is writing in will not have any need for certain characters.  A drawback is
				this: if for whatever reason there is need for any of these characters, that glyph 
				will be rendered in a different font, which might not look great. This same effect can also happen when mixing local fonts and web fonts.  As Bram Stein points out:</p>
				<p><q> Many web fonts differ from their desktop version. Web fonts are often subsets (i.e. they do not contain the same characters) 
				or are otherwise modified for web use….The chance that a web font is exactly the same as an installed font with the same name is very slim.<q> (2015)</p>
			<div class="pure-u-1">
				<h2>Four: Where We Are Headed</h2>
				<p>Programs like sIFR foresaw the need for text which was itself expandable and contractible, at least as far as the space it was given.  
				But it was technologies like this which paved the way for possibly future ones which can be more responsive to how we are viewing them.  
				As more and more sites are being seen on different formats, everything from media to site grids themselves has to start thinking about creating more responsive options.  
				And fonts are no exception. There is a movement to create responsive fonts, which won’t conform to the traditional 100-900 weight scale of normal fonts.  
				Through new CSS coding, typographer Nick Sherman has put forward a proposal to create responsive font which would be able to expand and adjust with the size of the screen.  
				Citing previous programs such as Adobe’s Multiple Master font format from the ‘90s, adjustable fonts would give programs better-fitting content and headlines and take up even less data.</p>
