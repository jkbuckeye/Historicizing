				<h2>One</h2>
				<p>In my historicizing project, I am going to look at what it took to convert the fonts we have been 
				using for the printed word into web-ready versions.  I found out there are aspects
				of projecting fonts that I would not have thought of before.  These aspects affect how a specific font 
				is rendered to most closely reflect the author or designers intentions with a message.  Let's look at some of the tools, skills
				people and movements which went in to web fonts as we now know them.</p>

				<p>
				Another method called CUFON is said to be a worthy alternative to the 
				aforementioned image-replacement. It requires the enabling of Javascript on a browser, and like sIFR, not all foundries and typeface makers allow their fonts to be used with it free of charge.
				</p>
				<p>
				Speaking for those of a certain feeling, the inventor of sIFR explained, Do we like standards? Yes, we do. But will we sacrifice our own ability to create better work on the web because of them? No, we won’t. Well, some people will.  I won’t.

				<h2>Issues</h2>
				<p>
				Subsetting is a method by which a web designer can manually eliminate certain glyphs from a given font, 
				assuming that the language he is writing in will not have any need for certain characters.  A drawback is
				this: if for whatever reason there is need for any of these characters, that glyph 
				will be rendered in a different font, which might not look great. This same effect can also happen when mixing local fonts and web fonts.  As Bram Stein points out:
				</p>
				<p>
				&ldquo;Many web fonts differ from their desktop version. Web fonts are often subsets (i.e. they do not contain the same characters) 
				or are otherwise modified for web use….The chance that a web font is exactly the same as an installed font with the same name is very slim<&rdquo; (2015).

				<h2>What Is Motivating Font Rendering Development</h2>
				<p>
				I’ve started to wonder about what effects the way people view technology has on what the technology later becomes.  
				It seems evident that in the case of Web-based fonts, we can take Bijkers third concept from his theory of sociotechnical 
				change and prognosticate out what it means in the long run.  As such there may have been (and perhaps still are) multiple 
				interpretations of what web fonts originally were in the role of web site design.  In their original form, it seems that 
				there was a predominant construct of them as very simply defined and carried out, and not having as much of a role in what 
				a site was.  This can be seen in how web fonts were originally coded in HTML itself.  As there became more of an understanding 
				of fonts as more complicated and worthy of a good deal more code, the interpretation of fonts as a more complicated and much 
				more integral piece of the design of websites took over and it is now easily rendered using CSS.  Likely both of these interpretations 
				of fonts themselves existed at the same time, because they have not changed all that much.  But as the predominant interpretation of 
				what they are has changed, so too has how they are used and what technologies and elements are put in place to facilitate this use.
