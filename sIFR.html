			<h1>sIFR</h1>
				<p>SIFR, which was invented in 2004, is another way to render text that is not your bland, everyday browser fare. What sIFR does is very similar to image replacement, but it grants more sizing capabilities 
				and allows the text to more succinctly blend into the content of a page as if it were written in the HTML of the webpage.  It does, however, require a Flashplayer to render, 
				which not everyone has, and it uses Javascript to over-write the HTML code if the appropriate player is installed.</p>
				<p>sIFR: Like the Swiss designers who advanced the international style, Berners-Lee….
			strongly believed that good design and responsible use of technology would advance positive cultural change (Dilger, 217)</p>
				<p>sIFR is most closely a product of the side of the web-designing world which values 
				the aesthetics and looks of their product over certain potential technological and 
				efficiency drawbacks which could hinder certain other uses for it.  Like the web designers 
				who tried to advance the international style, the proponents of font-face and other more 
				easily coded elements want the web to run as efficiently as possible, sometimes at the 
				expense of the most unique or beautiful designs.  They would side with Muller-Brockman who 
				said “acknowledged the importance of beauty, but insisted that ‘emotional’ creativity must 
				be tempered with intellectual and rational discourse, lest designs fail to achieve their logical and 
				systemic approach (218).  The program has been acknowledged as a little more difficult to get to render 
				on all browsers, as it is basically a video, which is rendered using Flash (‘s modern equivalent).  
				But it does allow for more different options and often fewer legal entanglements.
